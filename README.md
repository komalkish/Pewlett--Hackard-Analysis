## Overview of the Analysis
# Purpose
Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions—you’ll need to use the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. Then, use the COUNT() function to create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.

## Results
From the finding of the eligible retirees, High Percentage of the workforce could retire at any given time.
From the job titles of the eligible retirees, the breakdown is below.
32,452 Staff
29,415 Senior Engineer
14,221 Engineer
8,047 Senior Staff
4,502 Technique Leader
1,761 Assistant Engineer

## Summary

We have 1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
90,398 roles are in urgent need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring at any given time.
